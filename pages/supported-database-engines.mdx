# Supported Database Engines

Shlink officially supports four major database engines, giving you flexibility in choosing the right database solution for your infrastructure. Whether you're running a small personal instance or a large-scale deployment, Shlink has you covered.

## Supported Databases

Shlink supports the following database engines:

- **MySQL** (5.7 or higher recommended)
- **MariaDB** (10.3 or higher recommended)
- **PostgreSQL** (10 or higher recommended)
- **Microsoft SQL Server** (2017 or higher recommended)
- **SQLite** (for development and small deployments)

All database engines are fully supported with feature parity, meaning you can choose the one that best fits your needs without sacrificing functionality.

## MySQL

MySQL is one of the most popular open-source relational database management systems and is fully supported by Shlink.

### Configuration

To use MySQL with Shlink, you need to configure the following environment variables:

```bash
DB_DRIVER=mysql
DB_NAME=shlink
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
```

Additionally, you'll need the `pdo_mysql` PHP extension installed.

### SSL/TLS Encryption

MySQL supports encrypted connections. To enable SSL encryption for your MySQL connection, set:

```bash
DB_USE_ENCRYPTION=true
```

When encryption is enabled, Shlink will:
- Require SSL connections (PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_KEY)
- Accept any certificate (PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_SSL_VERIFY_SERVER_CERT set to false)

### Unix Socket Connections

For improved performance when the database is on the same host, you can use Unix socket connections:

```bash
DB_UNIX_SOCKET=/path/to/mysql.sock
```

### Character Set

Shlink uses `utf8mb4` character set for MySQL connections to ensure full Unicode support, including emojis and special characters.

### Limitations

- **Transactions in Migrations**: Database migrations are **not transactional** on MySQL. The migration template explicitly disables transactions for MySQL platforms to avoid issues with DDL statements that implicitly commit.

## MariaDB

MariaDB is a community-developed fork of MySQL and is fully compatible with Shlink. It's often preferred for its performance improvements and additional features.

### Configuration

MariaDB configuration is nearly identical to MySQL:

```bash
DB_DRIVER=maria
DB_NAME=shlink
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
```

You'll need the `pdo_mysql` PHP extension (MariaDB uses the same PDO driver as MySQL).

### SSL/TLS Encryption

Like MySQL, MariaDB supports encrypted connections:

```bash
DB_USE_ENCRYPTION=true
```

The same SSL configuration applies as with MySQL.

### Unix Socket Connections

MariaDB also supports Unix socket connections for local database servers:

```bash
DB_UNIX_SOCKET=/path/to/mariadb.sock
```

### Character Set

Shlink uses `utf8mb4` character set for MariaDB connections, ensuring full Unicode support.

### Limitations

- **Transactions in Migrations**: Like MySQL, database migrations are **not transactional** on MariaDB. The migration system explicitly disables transactions for MariaDB to avoid issues with DDL operations.

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its standards compliance and advanced features.

### Configuration

To use PostgreSQL with Shlink:

```bash
DB_DRIVER=postgres
DB_NAME=shlink
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```

You'll need the `pdo_pgsql` PHP extension installed.

### SSL/TLS Encryption

PostgreSQL supports encrypted connections using SSL:

```bash
DB_USE_ENCRYPTION=true
```

When encryption is enabled, Shlink configures:
- `sslmode=require` - Requires encrypted connections
- `sslrootcert=''` - Allows any certificate (useful for self-signed certificates)

### Character Set

Shlink uses `utf8` character set for PostgreSQL connections.

### Limitations

PostgreSQL has **no known limitations** when used with Shlink. All features, including transactional migrations, work as expected.

## Microsoft SQL Server

Microsoft SQL Server is fully supported, making Shlink a great choice for organizations with existing SQL Server infrastructure.

### Configuration

To use Microsoft SQL Server with Shlink:

```bash
DB_DRIVER=mssql
DB_NAME=shlink
DB_USER=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=1433
```

You'll need:
- The `pdo_sqlsrv` PHP extension
- Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server (version 18 or higher)

### SSL/TLS Encryption

SQL Server connections can be encrypted, though Shlink currently configures connections to trust the server certificate:

```bash
DB_USE_ENCRYPTION=true
```

The driver option `TrustServerCertificate` is set to `true` to allow connections without certificate validation.

### Installation Notes

When setting up SQL Server support, you need to install the Microsoft ODBC Driver. On Ubuntu/Debian systems:

```bash
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | apt-key add -
curl https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/24.04/prod.list > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-release.list
apt-get update
ACCEPT_EULA=Y apt-get install msodbcsql18
```

### Limitations

Microsoft SQL Server has **no known limitations** when used with Shlink. All features work as expected, including transactional migrations.

## SQLite

SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database that's perfect for development, testing, or small deployments.

### Configuration

SQLite is the default database engine and requires minimal configuration:

```bash
DB_DRIVER=sqlite
```

Or simply don't set `DB_DRIVER` at all, as SQLite is the default.

The database file is stored at `data/database.sqlite` relative to your Shlink installation directory.

### When to Use SQLite

SQLite is ideal for:
- **Development environments**: Quick setup with no external dependencies
- **Small personal instances**: Perfect for low-traffic personal URL shorteners
- **Testing**: Fast and disposable database for running tests
- **Portable deployments**: Single-file database that's easy to backup and move

### When NOT to Use SQLite

Avoid SQLite for:
- **High-traffic production sites**: SQLite has limited concurrent write capabilities
- **Multi-server deployments**: SQLite is file-based and cannot be shared across multiple servers
- **Large datasets**: Performance degrades with very large numbers of short URLs and visits

### Limitations

- **Concurrency**: Limited support for concurrent writes. High-traffic sites should use a client-server database.
- **No network access**: Being file-based, SQLite cannot be accessed remotely or shared across multiple application servers.

## Migration Between Database Engines

Shlink does not provide built-in tools for migrating data between different database engines. If you need to switch from one database to another:

### Manual Migration Process

1. **Export your data**: Use your current database's export tools to create a backup
2. **Set up the new database**: Create an empty database in your target engine
3. **Update Shlink configuration**: Change the `DB_DRIVER` and related environment variables
4. **Run migrations**: Execute `vendor/bin/doctrine-migrations migrate` to create the schema
5. **Import data**: Manually import your data, being mindful of any syntax differences

### Using Database Tools

Consider using database migration tools like:
- **pgLoader**: Excellent for migrating from MySQL/MariaDB to PostgreSQL
- **Database-specific tools**: Most database engines provide their own import/export utilities
- **ETL tools**: For complex migrations, consider Extract-Transform-Load tools

### Important Considerations

- **Test thoroughly**: Always test your migration in a non-production environment first
- **Backup everything**: Create complete backups before starting any migration
- **Schema differences**: Be aware that different databases may handle certain data types differently
- **Downtime**: Plan for downtime during the migration process

## Docker Compose Examples

Shlink's docker-compose.yml file includes examples for all supported databases:

### MySQL Example

    environment:
        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root
        MYSQL_DATABASE: shlink
```

### Microsoft SQL Server Example

```yaml
shlink_db_ms:
    container_name: shlink_db_ms
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest
    ports:

    environment:
        ACCEPT_EULA: Y
        SA_PASSWORD: "Passw0rd!"
```

## Testing Across Databases

Shlink's test suite runs against all supported databases to ensure consistent behavior:

```bash
# Test with SQLite (default)
composer test:db:sqlite

# Test with MySQL
composer test:db:mysql

# Test with MariaDB
composer test:db:maria

# Test with PostgreSQL
composer test:db:postgres

# Test with Microsoft SQL Server
composer test:db:ms
```

This comprehensive testing ensures that all database engines provide the same functionality and behavior.
