# Supported Runtimes

Shlink can be served using different runtime environments, each with its own advantages and use cases. Understanding these options will help you choose the best deployment strategy for your needs.

## Overview

Shlink supports three primary runtime options:

1. **RoadRunner** - A high-performance PHP application server (recommended for production)
2. **FrankenPHP** - A modern PHP application server built on top of the Caddy web server
3. **Classic Web Server** - Traditional PHP-FPM with nginx, Apache, or similar web servers

Each runtime has different performance characteristics, resource requirements, and operational considerations. The choice depends on your infrastructure, expected traffic, and operational preferences.

## RoadRunner

RoadRunner is the recommended runtime for Shlink in production environments. It's a high-performance PHP application server written in Go that keeps your application in memory between requests, resulting in significantly faster response times.

### Key Features

- **High Performance**: Keeps PHP workers in memory, eliminating bootstrap overhead on every request
- **Built-in Worker Management**: Automatically manages PHP worker processes
- **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Support**: Native support for modern HTTP protocols
- **Job Queue Processing**: Integrated support for background job processing
- **Low Memory Footprint**: Efficient resource utilization compared to traditional PHP-FPM setups

### When to Use RoadRunner

RoadRunner is ideal when:

- You need maximum performance and low response times
- You're running Shlink with moderate to high traffic
- You want simplified deployment with the official Docker image
- You need built-in support for background jobs and async processing

### Version Support

Shlink uses **RoadRunner 2024** (the latest major version). The official Docker image comes with RoadRunner pre-configured and ready to use.

### Configuration

When using the Docker image, RoadRunner is the default runtime. The server configuration is managed automatically, but you can customize certain aspects using environment variables:

- `PORT`: The port RoadRunner listens on (default: 8080)
- `ADDRESS`: The IP address to bind to (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `WEB_WORKER_NUM`: Number of HTTP workers to spawn
- `TASK_WORKER_NUM`: Number of background task workers

For self-hosted installations, RoadRunner can be downloaded using:

```bash
php ./vendor/bin/rr get
```

The binary will be placed in the `bin/` directory and can be started with:

```bash
./bin/rr serve -c config/roadrunner/.rr.yml
```

## FrankenPHP

FrankenPHP is a modern PHP application server built on top of the Caddy web server. It provides similar benefits to RoadRunner with a different architecture and additional features inherited from Caddy.

### Key Features

- **Caddy Integration**: Leverages Caddy's powerful features including automatic HTTPS
- **Worker Mode**: Keeps PHP workers in memory like RoadRunner
- **Early Hints Support**: Supports HTTP 103 Early Hints for improved performance
- **Modern Architecture**: Built with Go and modern web standards in mind

### When to Use FrankenPHP

FrankenPHP is a good choice when:

- You prefer Caddy's ecosystem and configuration approach
- You want automatic HTTPS certificate management out of the box
- You're looking for an alternative to RoadRunner with similar performance characteristics
- You want to experiment with newer PHP server technologies

### Version Support

Shlink added FrankenPHP support in **version 4.6.0**. The worker script is available at `bin/frankenphp-worker.php`.

### Configuration

To run Shlink with FrankenPHP:

```bash
frankenphp php-server --worker bin/frankenphp-worker.php
```

FrankenPHP can be configured through its standard configuration mechanisms. Refer to the [FrankenPHP documentation](https://frankenphp.dev/) for detailed configuration options.

## Classic Web Server

The traditional approach uses PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) paired with a web server like nginx or Apache. This is the most familiar setup for many PHP developers and system administrators.

### Key Features

- **Proven Technology**: Battle-tested approach used by millions of PHP applications
- **Wide Compatibility**: Works with any web server that supports FastCGI
- **Familiar Tooling**: Standard PHP deployment practices apply
- **Flexible Configuration**: Full control over PHP-FPM and web server settings

### When to Use a Classic Web Server

A classic web server setup is appropriate when:

- You're already running PHP-FPM infrastructure
- You prefer traditional deployment methods
- You have existing expertise with nginx or Apache
- You're running Shlink on shared hosting or restricted environments
- You have minimal traffic and don't need the performance benefits of worker-based servers

### Version Support

Shlink requires:

- **PHP**: 8.4 or 8.5
- **Web Server**: Any web server supporting PHP-FPM (nginx, Apache, Lighttpd, etc.)

### PHP Extensions Required

Regardless of the web server used, the following PHP extensions are required:

- `json`
- `curl`
- `pdo`
- `intl`
- `gd`
- `gmp` or `bcmath`

Additional recommended extensions:

- `apcu` - For caching (highly recommended with classic web servers)
- `sockets` - Required for RabbitMQ integration
- Database-specific PDO extensions: `pdo_mysql`, `pdo_pgsql`, `pdo_sqlsrv`, or `pdo_sqlite`

### Setup Example with Nginx

1. **Configure PHP-FPM**: Ensure PHP-FPM is running with the required extensions

2. **Configure Nginx**: Create a server block pointing to Shlink's `public/` directory

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;
    root /path/to/shlink/public;
    index index.php;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
    }
}
```

3. **Set Permissions**: Ensure the `data/` directory is writable by the web server

```bash
chmod -R 775 data/
chown -R www-data:www-data data/
```

### Setup Example with Apache

1. **Enable Required Modules**:

```bash
a2enmod rewrite
a2enmod proxy_fcgi
a2enmod setenvif
```

2. **Configure Virtual Host**:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName your-domain.com
    DocumentRoot /path/to/shlink/public

    <Directory /path/to/shlink/public>
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    <FilesMatch \.php$>
        SetHandler "proxy:unix:/var/run/php/php8.4-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost"
    </FilesMatch>
</VirtualHost>
```

3. **Use Provided .htaccess**: Shlink includes a `.htaccess` file in the `public/` directory that handles URL rewriting

## Performance Comparison

The choice of runtime significantly impacts performance:

| Runtime | Requests/sec* | Memory Usage | Setup Complexity |
|---------|---------------|--------------|------------------|
| RoadRunner | ~3000-5000 | Low | Low (with Docker) |
| FrankenPHP | ~2500-4500 | Low | Medium |
| Classic (PHP-FPM) | ~500-1000 | Medium | Medium |

*Approximate values, actual performance depends on hardware, configuration, and workload.

### Key Performance Factors

- **Worker-based servers** (RoadRunner, FrankenPHP) keep the application in memory, eliminating PHP bootstrap time
- **Classic setups** restart PHP on every request, incurring bootstrap overhead
- **Caching** is more critical with classic setups; consider using APCu or Redis
- **Database connections** are more efficiently managed with worker-based servers

## Docker Deployment

The official Docker image uses RoadRunner by default, but you can choose your preferred runtime using build arguments or image tags.

### Available Image Tags

- `shlinkio/shlink:latest` - Latest stable version with default runtime (RoadRunner)
- `shlinkio/shlink:4.6.0-roadrunner` - Specific version with RoadRunner
- `shlinkio/shlink:4.6.0-openswoole` - Specific version with Openswoole (legacy)

### Switching Runtimes in Docker

The Docker image is built with the `SHLINK_RUNTIME` argument:

```dockerfile
ARG SHLINK_RUNTIME=rr
ENV SHLINK_RUNTIME=${SHLINK_RUNTIME}
```

The entrypoint script automatically detects the runtime and starts the appropriate server.

## Choosing the Right Runtime

### Choose RoadRunner if:
- You want the best performance
- You're deploying with Docker
- You need background job processing
- You want a production-ready setup with minimal configuration

### Choose FrankenPHP if:
- You want modern PHP server features
- You prefer Caddy's ecosystem
- You want to try cutting-edge technology
- You need automatic HTTPS management

### Choose Classic Web Server if:
- You're already running PHP-FPM infrastructure
- You have low traffic requirements
- You prefer traditional deployment methods
- You're on shared hosting or have infrastructure constraints

## Migration Between Runtimes

Switching between runtimes is straightforward since Shlink's core functionality is runtime-agnostic:

1. **Backup your data**: Always backup your database and configuration
2. **Install the new runtime**: Follow the specific setup instructions
3. **Update your configuration**: Adjust environment variables or config files as needed
4. **Test thoroughly**: Verify all features work correctly with the new runtime
5. **Monitor performance**: Check that the new runtime meets your performance requirements

No database migrations or data transformations are needed when changing runtimes.
